<img src="https://kodama-community.github.io/docs/assets/kodama.svg" title="kodama" width=150 /> 

A [Typst](https://github.com/typst/typst)-friendly static Zettelk√§sten site generator.

[![Ask DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/badge.svg)](https://deepwiki.com/kokic/kodama)

## Features

- Single binary, command-line program.

- Typst support, which compiles via Typst installed on the user's device and embeds as SVG / HTML, thus all Typst features are available. Additionally, there are style optimizations for inline formulas written in Typst.

- Fully automatic support for light and dark themes, including for formulas or color images output by Typst. Users can also manually adjust any detail of the website style without needing to rebuild the Kodama tool itself.

- Organize Markdown files in the manner of [Jon Sterling](https://www.jonmsterling.com/index/index.xml)'s [Forester](https://www.forester-notes.org/index/index.xml).
